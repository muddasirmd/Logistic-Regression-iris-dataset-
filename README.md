# LogisticRegression IRIS Dataset

### When To use

Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical.

For example,

1. To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0)
2. Whether the tumor is malignant (1) or not (0)

#### Types of Logistic Regression

1. Binary Logistic Regression

The categorical response has only two 2 possible outcomes. Example: Spam or Not

2. Multinomial Logistic Regression

Three or more categories without ordering. Example: Predicting which food is preferred more (Veg, Non-Veg, Vegan)

3. Ordinal Logistic Regression

Three or more categories with ordering. Example: Movie rating from 1 to 5


### Pros

1. One of the simplest machine learning algorithms.
2. 

### Cons

1. Non linear problems can't be solved
2. It is difficult to capture complex relationships
3. It requires moderate or no multicollinearity between independent variables
